# RockML

The RockML library is designed to aid in developing, testing, and deploying 
machine-learning models for subsurface characterization. The library is written 
for Python 3.6 and includes two main namespaces: data preprocessing and learning. 
The former provides adapters for common seismic data formats, i.e., SEGY, 
well-logs, and horizon geometries. It also provides many transformations and 
visualizations for the data. The learning module includes callbacks, data loaders, 
metrics, and state-of-the-art models for post-stack segmentation and VA estimation.
